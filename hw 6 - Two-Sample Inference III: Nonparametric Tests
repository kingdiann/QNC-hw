Exercise 1: I would use a Mann-Whitney test because these are two samples coming from different populations with two different distributions. We want to determine whether and how the distributions of the geode vs limestone differ. 
Exercise 2: I would use a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test whether the sample came from a population with a particular value. In this case that would be looking to see whether the difference in age of the participants before v after the treatment is significantly different than 0 (no change).
Exercise 3: I would use a Sign test because the populations are paired (they are the same group of people attributed to two different values) and we want to prove/disprove the null hypothesis that the device had no effect on their ranking of the product ("no systematic direction of treatment effect"). A positive skew indicates a increase in treatment effect so if the device made them like the product more then there would be a systematic effect in the positive direction.
